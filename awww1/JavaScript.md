JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2024[update], 98.8% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
